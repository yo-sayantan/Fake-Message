This was our project for Trident Hackathon.

After executing the code in Jupyter notebook the trained model will be saved in the directory.
The training datas are in ghe .csv format.
The final_model.sav is the trained model.
The GUI_copy file is the Tkinter UI connected with the trained model at the backened.
This UI accepts string and gives output as True or Fake.

Thank You.
